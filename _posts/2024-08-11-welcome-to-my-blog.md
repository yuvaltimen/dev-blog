I'm someone who gets obsessed with things. What things? Well, to name a few... 

- Math.
- History.
- Software.
- Data.
- Maps. 

You name it.

And when I do sink my teeth into my next victim, I often find 
that I need an outlet in order to synthesize my thoughts about what I'm reading or doing. 

<!-- excerpt-start -->
I've often found a lot of pleasure in just spending a day hacking away on a Markdown 
document to fully flesh out my ideas, to nail down my understanding about a topic, or just 
to see the swirling mass of figures and pictures in my head materialize in front of me.

This is why I created this blog. The purpose of it is to serve my purposes of organizing my 
brain in a way that is presentable to me and to anyone else who may stumble upon it. 

So to my readers, I bid thee fair winds in thy sails! Feel free to reach out if you wanna talk. 

'Til next time!
